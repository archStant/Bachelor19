\section{Conclusion}
The aim this paper was to put to test the question of whether applying multi-task learning to a convolutional neural network could help improve its accuracy in regards to predicting protein secondary structures.\\
To do this we built first a single-task model predicting Q8 secondary structures from amino acid recidues as well as the sequence profiling, as well as a similar model for predicting relative and absolute solvent accessibility.\\
We then built another model combining these two elements in a hard parameter-sharing multi-task learning neural network, and optimized this with regards to hyperparameters number of layers, learning rate, layer depth and kernel size.\\
Training these three models with the optimized parameters showed that while the single-task model was slightly better at predicting solvent accessibilities, the multi-task model did indeed outperform the single-task when it came to predicting secondary structures.\\
At the offset of this project we used articles by \textbf{CITER ALLE ARTIKLERNE}, noting that authors Wang et al. had also built a convolutional neural network (DeepCNF-SS) with the same goals, reaching a Q8 accuracy of 75.2\% on the same data set as we have used, while we with our model only achieved 71.24\% on our single-task and 71.57\% on our multi-task models. Differences between DeepCNF-SS and our single-task model include both use use of regularization and the use of a Conditional Random Field as a precursive layer. \\
Since our results showed an increase in accuracy when expanding the scope of the model to multi-task learning, one can speculate if a similar increase in performance could be expected if one was to implement multi-task learning into Wang et al.'s superior model.

Modellen blev ikke bedre, men blev nogenlunde god til både at forudsige struktur og solvent-egenskaber.
Vi kan have nogle overvejelser omkring hvad vi kunne have gjort bedre, f.eks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gaussisk filtrering over dataen
\item Evt. soft parameter sharing
\item Regularization hvis vi tør
\item En anden opbygning af multi-modellen hvor der var et enkelt eller flere fully-connected layers til solvent-egenskaberne.
\end{itemize}
