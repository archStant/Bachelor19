\section*{Abstract}
In this paper we explore the theory underlying proteins and features of the amino acids they are comprised of, exploring aspects such as secondary protein structures and solvent accessibility.\\
We then delve into the theory behind artificial neural networks, deliberating basic subjects such as the structure of neural networks and \textit{backprobagation}, as well as explaining the extentions to this concept called \textit{convolutional neural networks} and \textit{multi-task learning}.\\
We then introduce a dataset originally produced by
